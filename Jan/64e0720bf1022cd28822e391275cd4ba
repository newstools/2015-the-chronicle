MATSOSANGWAO, a Botswana cultural group, says they are seeking co-operation with local traditional groups in order to build strong ties between the two countries. The 25-member group, which was in Bulawayo on Wednesday, provided entertainment during a Botswana Cultural Dinner at the Large City Hall. One of the group’s members, Chix Makgasane, said they were impressed with the richness of culture that was in the city after having shared the stage with Iluba Lemvelo. “We’re in Zimbabwe to seek opportunities to work with cultural groups here. Sharing the stage with Iluba Lemvelo was a good experience as they showed us some parts of Zimbabwean culture that we didn’t know,” Makgasane said. During the show the cultural group gave guests a top notch performance with their dances that were filled with high energy and verve. They started off their dances with the Sepata that was popularised by Bulawayo group Umkhathi Theatre Works. Clad in brown leather shorts, Matsosangwao members wore sandals on their feet, which cushioned the impact of the stamping action. The striking of the foot against the floor was pivotal in this dance. The men excelled in this dance with different hip poses.
