THE Minister for War Veterans and War Collaborators Welfare, Cde Christopher Mutsvangwa, faces ouster from the Zanu-PF Mashonaland West province amid moves to recommend his expulsion for allegedly undermining President Robert Mugabe and the First Lady, Cde Grace Mugabe. The provincial coordinating committee comprising Politburo members, central committee members, war veterans, provincial executive, youth and women’s leagues are understood to be behind the push and are appending their signatures to a petition to have Cde Mutsvangwa expelled. The top most grievance of the province was Cde Mutsvangwa’s utterances in the private media insinuating that President Mugabe was conflating the institution of marriage and party business. Last week, a private weekly quoted the War Vets Minister as saying: “We will always respect the institution of marriage and he’s confused and conflating the institution of marriage and that of the State,” apparently referring to President Mugabe. A provincial member said the writing was on the wall for the war vets leader and our Harare Bureau understands that the decision to recommend the expulsion of Cde Mutsvangwa would be announced at a press conference today. “The statement that he gave to the private media was clearly aimed at President Mugabe and we will not tolerate his undermining of our leader,” said the impeccable source. “He (Cde Mutsvangwa) thinks he knows it all and is behaving like he is the only one who went to war. President Mugabe clarified that everyone played a part in the war and that we are all equal as members of the party and that gives us the right to call errant war veterans to order.” Troubles for the belligerent Cde Mutsvangwa have lately been mounting. In closing the 15th ZanuPF national people’s conference on Saturday, President Mugabe appeared to sting the war veterans leader, castigating “arrogant” leaders. Instead, President Mugabe heaped praise on Buhera South legislator Cde Joseph Chinotimba for being a humble and exemplary war veteran. He described the legislator as “practical and down to earth”. “He is down to earth. I’ve given you an example of a simple man who went, he had missed on his education but the people voted for him. But I know of some commanders at the top like (the late Josiah) Tungamirai who was humble yet he was commander of the Air Force. But the actions of some war veterans now cast all war veterans in bad light,’’ said President Mugabe. Interestingly, Cde Mutsvangwa’s woes appear to be a family affair after Manicaland province last week passed a vote of no confidence on his wife, Monica, for fanning factionalism.
